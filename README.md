# Arab Pangenome Reference


Comprehensive Resource for the Arab World Delve into the intricate genetic tapestry that defines the Arab people. A Comprehensive Resource for the Arab World built with 86 Assemblies (43 Individuals)

86 Assemblies: Double the insight with assemblies from 43 individuals, ensuring a broad spectrum of genetic representation.
High-Definition Data: Utilizing 30x HiFi coverage and 50x ONT Ultra-long data, we offer unparalleled depth and accuracy in our genome sequences
Full-Length RNA Sequencing: Delve deeper into the transcriptomic landscape with full-length RNA sequencing performed on Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT).

# Analyses Notebooks

There are three main notebooks:

**Plotting pipeline** was used to plot the bandage plots 
**CSV analysis** was used to analyse complex sites in the pangenome
**gene analysis** was used to anotate genes in the complex regions

The other notebooks are supplemantary and were used to produce plots and stats for the assembly and the pangenome.

Since the analyses is being performed on graph pangenome, the run time for each segment of is around 1 minute to produce the sub-gfa files.
